            The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. 
            It orbits at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi),
            about 30 times the planet's diameter.
            The Moon always presents the same side to Earth, 
            because gravitational pull has locked its rotation to the planet. 
            This results in the lunar day of 29.5 days matching the lunar month.
            <br><br>
            The Moon's gravitational pull and to a lesser extent the Sun's 
            are the main drivers of the tides.
            The Moon has a mass that amounts to 1.2% of Earth's, 
            and a diameter that is roughly one-quarter of Earth's or with 3,474 km (2,159 mi) about as wide as Australia.
            Within the Solar System it is the most massive and largest satellite in relation to its parent planet,
            the fifth most massive and largest moon overall, 
            and more massive and larger than all known dwarf planets

            The Moon is the brightest and largest object in our night sky.
            The Moon makes Earth a more livable planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its axis, 
            leading to a relatively stable climate. 
            It also causes tides, 
            creating a rhythm that has guided humans for thousands of years
            <br><br>
            Earth has just one moon  a rocky, 
            cratered place, 
            roughly a quarter the size of Earth and an average of 238,855 miles away. 
            The Moon can be seen with the naked eye most nights as it traces its 27-day orbit around our planet
